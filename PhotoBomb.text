PhotoBomb is a photo sharing platform designed to help users upload, organize, and share their images in a smart and social environment. It supports user registration, secure login, album creation, image tagging, and personalized sharing optionsâ€”making photo management simple and interactive.

This application is ideal for individuals or groups who want to store, curate, and share memories, whether casually with friends or in a more structured community setting. It includes features like private albums, tagging, and friend-based visibility controls, with potential for future AI-driven enhancements like automatic image recognition.

For this project, I used React.js for the Frontend, Node.js with Express for the Backend, MongoDB for the Database, and JWT for Authentication.
